---

## Slide 2: Introduction
- **Overview**: Introduction to IBD and its significance in clinical research.
- **Objective**: Analyze IBD clinical data to explore demographics, disease phenotypes, treatment types, and outcomes.

---

## Slide 3: Data Sources
- **Clinical Trial Data**: Datasets from sources like **clinicaltrials.gov**, **IBD Registry**, etc.
- **Simulated Data**: Example dataset used for the project.
- **Features Included**: Demographics, disease phenotype, treatment type, clinical outcomes.

---

## Slide 4: Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Data**: Median imputation and row removal for missing values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Age groups, disease severity classification.
- **Data Transformation**: One-hot encoding for categorical features.

---

## Slide 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Key Visualizations**:
  - Age and gender distribution.
  - Disease severity across different age groups.
  - Correlation heatmap between variables.
- **Insights**: Key patterns and trends identified during EDA.

---

## Slide 6: Statistical Analysis
- **ANOVA Test**: Comparing disease severity across age groups.
- **Logistic Regression**: Predicting severe disease based on demographics and treatment type.
- **Results**: Evaluation of model performance with metrics like accuracy and precision.

---
